# brugs_python_projects

This repository contains the helper python projects that I implemented in my Boutique Rugs Software Developer experience. 

Here is a summary of each script:

| script name        | summary           |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| imagebackground.py      | checks whether an image has a white background or not. | 
| imagecolor.py     | Maps the colors of an image to a set of colors. Returns an output of percentages for each mapping. Used Pillow to get image, Numpy and Scipy for arithmetic and array operations.    |   
| saveimages.py | Randomly selects 500 images from a csv file and classify those images to folders according to they have white background. Used for image labeling test.     |  
| youtubechrome.py | Randomly opens 100 videos from a csv file in web browser sequentially. Used for logo labeling test.  |
